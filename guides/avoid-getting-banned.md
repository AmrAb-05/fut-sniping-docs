# FC 24 Bans and How To Avoid Them

### Why are we telling you this? How can we prevent this?

Now this does seem scary which is why we have the following advice to keep you safe when using the sniping tool, when used correctly and not abused, you can use the sniping tool without facing any consequences, as many users have done since the bot was first released.

To avoid bans we suggest running your bot for shorter periods of time in multiple sessions throughout the day.

### How many searches should I do at a time to keep my account safe?

We recommend that you **DO NOT** exceed 1,500 searches per day. The reason for this is to ensure your account stays safe and avoids bans. If you run the bot continuously until it hits 1,000 searches, you are almost guaranteed to receive a soft ban. Therefore we recommend you run the bot in separate sessions as we believe this will help to keep your account safe.

We **DO NOT** advise running the bot with no variation in search times, as what legitimate player would search consistently every 2 seconds on the dot? By this, we mean using, for example, 3-5 under your Delay Time setting, instead of 4.

What is also important to remember is if you run the bot with a search delay of below 1.5 seconds for longer than 3-5 minutes, you are more likely to get soft banned. Any time setting below this might display signs of bot usage to EA, so this may increase your risk of getting banned.

### What are the best bot settings to use?**

To see our recommended settings, head over to ‚Å†#bot-commands and type !settings for seller content time filters or type ?bigsettings for big snipe settings.

The reason for variation in settings is because at content time (6PM UK time), we are looking to buy cards and sell them instantly. Therefore we want to buy and sell as quickly as we can.

Big snipe settings are much broader as we leave the bot to run for a more extended duration to search the market, as this is about being at the right place and the right time.

### Is it safe to leave my bot overnight?

We strongly advise that no user leaves their bot unattended for any amount of time. Leaving the bot to run by itself significantly increases your chance of receiving some sort of market ban. Some users claim they do this and have been completely safe, but you must be aware that if you do this, and miss a captcha or become soft banned and the bot attempts to continuously searches, you will probably get banned.

We heavily advise users to never leave the bot unattended and advise all users to solve the captchas manually. However if you are using an account that you are deliberately exposing to the risks of a ban, this is your choice, **WE DO NOT RECCOMEND DOING THIS**.
