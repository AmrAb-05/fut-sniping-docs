# VPS Setup

Having good connection to the EA servers is important to help you win more snipes. If you're connection speed isn't great, you can setup a VPS (Virtual Private Server) which will give you a faster connection speed. In this guide, we'll walk you through how you can check your connection speed to the EA servers, and how to setup a free VPS if you want to improve your connection speed.

## Checking you connection speed

!!!
Remember that your connection speed to the EA servers is not the same as your internet connection speed. Having a good internet connection does not necessarily mean that your connection speed to the EA servers will be good too.
