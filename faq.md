## How do I install the Sniping Bot?

Please see our [Getting Started](/getting-started) guide for detailed installation instructions.

## Can I use the Sniping Bot on more than 1 device or EA account?

For each Sniping Bot account, there are 2 rules when it comes to using the Bot with multiple devices or EA accounts:
1. You can only run 1 instance of the Sniping Bot at a time. For example, you cannot run the Bot on both your laptop and PC at the same time. It will cause your Web App to crash on one of your devices.
2. You can switch EA accounts at any time as long as you are on the same device. And you can switch devices at any time as long as you're on the same EA account. If you want to switch both the device *and* the EA account that you're using, you can only do this once every 7 days.

**Example 1:**
If you have 2 different devices, 1 at home and 1 at work. You want to use them both with the same EA account, and you won't be using both at the same time. __This will be absolutely fine :+1:.__

**Example 2:**
You want to share your Sniping Bot account with your friend. He has his own laptop and own EA account, so __this will not work. Your friend will need to buy his own license.__
