## Login Issues

### `Couldn't connect to server` error when logging in to the Chrome Extension
The vast majority of the time, this issue is caused by an SSL certificate issue on your device. To check if this is the case, go to https://futsnipingbot.com, and look at the left of the URL bar. If you see `not secure`, it means there is an issue with the device that you're using, most likely because it's an old device. You will need to use a different device to access the Sniping Bot.

### I've logged in but can't see the Sniping Bot option in the web app

## Sniping Bot Issues

### The bot doesn't find anything, no matter what price I put
If you're constantly getting `Found 0 items`, even though it's supposed to display results, try clicking the `Reset` button (near the `Search` button), then input your filter again.

### I keep getting Buy Failed
The 2 most common reasons for this is that either:
1. Your settings need to be adjusted. Follow [this guide](/guides/maximising-profits) for help with optimising your settings.
2. You are soft banned. You can read more about soft bans [here](/guides/soft-bans.)
